# Installation

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Install scarb

To ensure the proper functioning of scaffold-stark, your local `Scarb` version must be `2.6.5`. To accomplish this, first check your local Scarb version:

```sh
scarb --version
```

If your local Scarb version is not `2.6.5`, you need to install it.

<details>
<summary><b>Scarb Installation Process</b></summary>

To install Scarb, please refer to the [installation instructions](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download).
We strongly recommend that you install
Scarb via [asdf](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf), a CLI tool that can manage
multiple language runtime versions on a per-project basis.
This will ensure that the version of Scarb you use to work on a project always matches the one defined in the
project settings, avoiding problems related to version mismatches.

Please refer to the [asdf documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) to install all
prerequisites.

Once you have `asdf` installed locally, you can download Scarb plugin with the following command:

```bash
asdf plugin add scarb
```

This will allow you to download specific versions. You can choose the same version as the Dojo's Cairo version, for example, 2.6.5, with the following command:

```bash
asdf install scarb 2.6.5
```

and set a global version:

```bash
asdf global scarb 2.6.5
```

Otherwise, you can simply run the following command in your terminal, and follow the onscreen instructions. This
will install the version `2.6.5` of Scarb.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh -s -- -v 2.6.5
```

</details>

## Compatible versions

- scarb - v2.6.5
- cairo - v2.6.4
- starknet - v2.5.4
- sierra - v1.4.0
- rpc - v0.7.0

## Setup

To get started with Scaffold-Stark 2, you have two options:

1. Follow readme to clone the repository.
2. **[Comming soon]** Use the npx command: ` npx create-stark@latest` to bootstrap the project directly.

### Option 1: Setup using `git clone`

Clone this repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quantum3-Labs/scaffold-stark-2 --recurse-submodules
cd scaffold-stark-2
yarn install
```

### Option 2: [Comming soon] Setup using `npx create-stark@latest`

For a simplified setup, Scaffold-Stark 2 offers a beta npx method that guides you interactively through the setup.

Bootstrap the project:

```
npx create-stark@latest
```

You will be presented with a series of prompts:

- **Project Name:** Input your project name: Enter a name for your project, e.g., my-dapp-example.
- **Install packages?:** Press `Enter` for `yes` (default option) or type `n` and press `Enter` for no

Once the setup is complete, navigate to the project directory:

```
cd project-name
```
