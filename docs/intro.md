# 🏗 Welcome to Scaffold-Stark

[Scaffold-Stark](https://github.com/Scaffold-Stark/scaffold-stark-2) is everything you need to get started building decentralized applications on Starknet! 🚀

⚙️ Built using NextJS, StarknetJS, Scarb, Starknet-React, Starknet Foundry and Typescript.

## About Scaffold-Stark

Scaffold-Stark is an open-source, up-to-date toolkit for building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Starknet blockchain. It's designed to make it easier for developers to create and deploy smart contracts and build user interfaces that interact with those contracts. Scaffold-Stark is a UI-agnostic framework, meaning it does not enforce any specific UI framework or library, giving developers the flexibility to choose their preferred UI tools and libraries.

- ✅ **Contract Fast Reload**: Your frontend auto-adapts to your smart contract as you edit it.
- 🔥 **Burner Wallet & Local Faucet**: Quickly test your application with a burner wallet and local faucet.
- 🔐 **Integration with Wallet Providers**: Connect to different wallet providers and interact with the Starknet network.

## Scaffold-Stark Tech Stack

Scaffold-Stark is not a product itself but more of a combination or stack of other great tools. It allows you to quickly build and iterate over your smart contracts and frontends.

Here are the main components:

- [**Starknet-Devnet-rs**](https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/starknet-devnet-rs) for running local networks
- [**Scarb**](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) to build/compile smart contracts
- [**StarknetJS**](https://www.starknetjs.com/docs/guides/intro) as low-level interface that provides primitives to interact with Starknet. Declaring and deploying smart contracts.The alternative to starknet-rs.
- [**Starknet-React**](https://starknet-react.com/docs/getting-started) Collection of React hooks wrapper around starknet-react to simplify interactions with smart contracts with typescript autocompletion.
- [**NextJS**](https://nextjs.org/docs) for building a frontend, using many useful pre-made hooks.
