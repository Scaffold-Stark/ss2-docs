# Installation

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Starkup

Tool for installing all the Starknet essentials for development. [Starkup](https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup) will install the latest stable versions of:

- [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) - Cairo package manager and build toolchain
- [Starknet Foundry](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/index.html) - Development toolchain for testing on Starknet
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) - Version manager to easily switch between tool versions
- [Cairo 1.0 extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkware.cairo1) for VSCode - Syntax highlighting and language support

Currently, [starknet-devnet](https://0xspaceshard.github.io/starknet-devnet/) is not supported by `starkup` and needs to be installed separately (see instructions below).

To install `starkup`, run the following command:

```sh
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starkware-libs/starkup/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Install scarb

To ensure the proper functioning of scaffold-stark, your `Scarb` version must be `2.11.4`. To accomplish this, first check your `Scarb` version:

```sh
scarb --version
```

If your Scarb version is not `2.11.4`, you need to install it.

<details>
<summary><b>Scarb Installation Process</b></summary>

 If you already have installed `Scarb` via `starkup`, you can setup this specific version with the following command:

```sh
asdf install scarb 2.11.4 && asdf set scarb 2.11.4
```

Otherwise, you can install Scarb `2.11.4` following the [installation instructions](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download).
We strongly recommend that you install
Scarb via [starkup](https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup) or [asdf](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf), a CLI tool that can manage
multiple language runtime versions on a per-project basis.
This will ensure that the version of Scarb you use to work on a project always matches the one defined in the
project settings, avoiding problems related to version mismatches.

Please refer to the [asdf documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) to install all
prerequisites.

Once you have `asdf` installed locally, you can download Scarb plugin with the following command:

```bash
asdf plugin add scarb
```

This will allow you to download specific versions. You can choose the same version as the Cairo's version, for example, 2.11.4, with the following command:

```bash
asdf install scarb 2.11.4
```

and set a version:

```bash
asdf set scarb 2.11.4
```

Otherwise, you can simply run the following command in your terminal, and follow the onscreen instructions. This
will install the version `2.11.4` of Scarb.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh -s -- -v 2.11.4
```

## Install Starknet Foundry

If your Starknet Foundry version is not 0.41.0, you need to install it.

```sh
snforge --version
```

<details>
<summary><b>Starknet Foundry Installation Process</b></summary>

If you already have installed `Starknet Foundry` via `starkup`, you can setup this specific version with the following command:

```sh
asdf install starknet-foundry 0.41.0 && asdf set starknet-foundry 0.41.0
```

Otherwise, you can install Starknet Foundry `0.41.0` following the [installation instructions](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/getting-started/installation.html#installation).
We strongly recommend that you install Starknet Foundry via [starkup](https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup) or [asdf](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/getting-started/installation.html#installation-via-asdf).

Once you have `asdf` installed locally, you can download Starknet Foundry plugin with the following command:

```bash
asdf plugin add starknet-foundry
```

This will allow you to download specific versions.

```bash
asdf install starknet-foundry 0.41.0
```

and set a version:

```bash
asdf set starknet-foundry 0.41.0
```

</details>

## Install `starknet-devnet`

To ensure the proper functioning of scaffold-stark, your starknet-devnet version must be 0.4.0.
To accomplish this, first check your starknet-devnet version:

```
starknet-devnet --version
```

If your `starknet-devnet` version is not `0.4.0`, you need to install it.

<details>
<summary><b>Starknet Devnet Installation Process</b></summary>

To install Starknet Devnet, please refer to the [installation instructions](https://0xspaceshard.github.io/starknet-devnet-rs/docs/running/install#install-with-asdf).  
This will ensure that the version of Starknet Devnet you use always matches the one defined in the project settings, avoiding version mismatches.

Please refer to the [`asdf` documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) to install all prerequisites.

Once you have `asdf` installed locally, you can add the Starknet Devnet plugin with the following command:

```bash
asdf plugin add starknet-devnet
```

This will allow you to download specific versions. You can install the compatible version **0.4.0** with:

```bash
asdf install starknet-devnet 0.4.0
```

and set a version:

```bash
asdf set starknet-devnet 0.4.0
```

Otherwise, you can simply run the following command in your terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.  
This will install the version **0.4.0** of Starknet Devnet:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/main/install.sh | bash -s -- -v 0.4.0
```

## Alternative Option with Docker

As an alternative to installing the tools locally (Scarb, Starknet Foundry, Starknet Devnet), you can use Docker. This is the recommended option for `Windows` users.

<details>
<summary><b>Docker Setup Process</b></summary>

To set up your environment using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
2. Install [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Use the provided `devcontainer.json` file to set up the environment:
   - The configuration uses the `starknetfoundation/starknet-dev:2.11.4` image.
   - This includes all required tools pre-installed, such as Scarb, Starknet Foundry, Starknet Devnet, and other dependencies.

### Getting Started with Docker Setup

To start using the Docker-based setup:

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Select **"Reopen in Container"**.
3. If you need to rebuild the container, open the Command Palette (**View -> Command Palette**) and choose:
   - **Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container**

> Once inside the container, you can start working with all the tools and dependencies pre-configured.

## Setup RPC specific version

To ensure the proper functioning of the scaffold-stark with Testnet or Mainnet, your RPC version must be `0.8.x`. This repository contains `.env.example` files, where we provided the default RPC URL for the Starknet Testnet: `RPC_URL_SEPOLIA=https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_8`. Let's verify this RPC version is `0.8.x` by calling a `POST` request in an API platform like `Postman` or `Insommia` . Your API endpoint should be `https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_8` and the body should be:

```json
{
 "jsonrpc":"2.0",
 "method":"starknet_specVersion",
 "id":1
}
```
You have to paste the endpoint and body in the API platform and click on the `Send` button. If the response is `0.8.x`, then you are good to go. Otherwise, you have to get the correct RPC URL endpoint.

## Compatible versions

| Dependency      | Version |
| --------------- | ------- |
| scarb           | v2.11.4 |
| cairo           | v2.11.4 |
| rpc             | v0.8.x  |
| starknet-devnet | v0.4.0  |
| snforge         | v0.41.0 |
| starknet.js     | v7.1.0  |
| starknet-react  | v3.7.2  |

## Setup

For a simplified setup, Scaffold-Stark offers a npx method that guides you interactively through the setup.

```
npx create-stark@latest
```

You will be presented with a series of prompts:

- **Project Name:** Input your project name: Enter a name for your project, e.g., my-dapp-example.
- **Install packages?:** Press `Enter` for `yes` (default option) or type `n` and press `Enter` for no

Once the setup is complete, navigate to the project directory:

```
cd project-name
```
