# Environment Setup

Now that our installation is complete, let's configure the development environment for Scaffold Stark.

### 1. **Initialize a Local Blockchain**:

Run a local network in the first terminal.

**Note:** You can skip this step if you want to use Sepolia Testnet.

```bash
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Starknet network using Devnet. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `scaffold.config.ts`.

### 2. Deploy your smart contract:

In the second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy --network {NETWORK_NAME} // when NETWORK_NAME is not specified, it defaults to "devnet"
```

**Note:** To use sepolia testnet, you have to set {NETWORK_NAME} to `sepolia`.

This command deploys a sample smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/snfoundry/contracts/src` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/snfoundry/scripts-ts/deploy.ts` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

The command also will create a file called `packages/nextjs/contracts/deployedContracts.ts` within the Next.js App, which would be the ABI source-of-truth for the Scaffold Hooks. This enables autocomplete to be activated when you are building the Next.js front-end of the application.

:::tip

Note that `yarn deploy` resets the generated `deployedContracts.ts` file be default. To keep the existing deployments and `deployedContracts.ts`, you can run:

```
yarn deploy:no-reset
```

:::

### 3. Launch your NextJS Application

On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

**What's next**:

- Edit your smart contract `YourContract.cairo` in `packages/snfoundry/contracts/src`.
- Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/snfoundry/script-ts/deploy.ts`.
- Edit your smart contract test in: `packages/snfoundry/contracts/src/test`. To run test use `yarn test`.
