# Deploy Your NextJS App

:::tip Hint
We recommend connecting your GitHub repo to Vercel (through the Vercel UI) so it gets automatically deployed when pushing to `main`.
:::tip Hint

If you want to deploy directly from the CLI, run this and follow the steps to deploy to Vercel:

```
yarn vercel
```

Once you log in (email, GitHub, etc.), the default options should work. It'll give you a public URL.

If you want to redeploy to the same production URL you can run:

```
yarn vercel --prod
```

If you omit the `--prod` flag it will deploy it to a preview/test URL.

**Make sure to check the values of your Scaffold Configuration before deploying your NextJS App.**

## Scaffold App Configuration

You can configure different settings for your dapp at `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

```ts
export type ScaffoldConfig = {
  targetNetworks: readonly Chain[];
  pollingInterval: number;
  rpcProviderUrl: string;
  walletAutoConnect: boolean;
  autoConnectTTL: number;

  // other configs you might have
  // e.g. tokenIcon: string;
};
```

The configuration parameters are described below. Make sure to update the values according to your needs:

#### - targetNetworks

Array of blockchain networks where your dapp is deployed. Use values from `supportedChains.ts`.

#### - pollingInterval

The interval in milliseconds at which your front-end application polls the RPC servers for fresh data. _Note that this setting does not affect the local network._

#### - rpcProviderUrl

Default RPC url from Scaffold-Stark 2.
If you are using your own RPC, you can put it within the `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVIDER_URL` environment variable.

#### - walletAutoConnect

Set it to `true` to activate automatic wallet connection behavior:

- If the user was connected into a wallet before, on page reload it reconnects automatically.
- If the user is not connected to any wallet, on reload, it connects to the burner wallet _if it is enabled for the current network_. See `onlyLocalBurnerWallet`

#### - autoConnectTTL

This will determine how long should the application persist wallet connection (i.e. wallets will auto-connect with in the time period), in milliseconds

You can extend this configuration file, adding new parameters that you need to use across your dapp **(make sure you update the above type `ScaffoldConfig`)**:

```ts
  tokenIcon: "ðŸ’Ž",
```

To use the values from the `ScaffoldConfig` in any other file of your application, you first need to import it in those files:

```ts
import scaffoldConfig from "~~/scaffold.config";
```
