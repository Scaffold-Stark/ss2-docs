# Deploy Your Smart Contracts

To deploy your smart contracts to a live network, there are a few things you need to adjust.

## 1. Configure your network

Scaffold-Stark 2 comes with a selection of predefined networks. They are `Devnet` and `Sepolia`.

Here are the [Starknet docs](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/tools/api-services/) for information on Seplia networks providers.

## 2. Use pre-funded accounts and add one of them to deploy the contract(s) from.

The deployer account is the account that will deploy your contracts. Additionally, the deployer account will be used to execute any function calls that are part of your deployment script.

You can use any pre-funded account / private key or add your crypto wallet's private key.

You can also manually set your own private key, you will need to add `PRIVATE_KEY_SEPOLIA=yourWalletPrivateKey` to the `packages/snfoundry/.env` file.

## 3. Deploy your smart contract(s)

By default `yarn deploy` will deploy contract to the local network. You can change `defaultNetwork` in `scaffold.config.ts`

Run the command below to deploy the smart contract to the target network. Make sure to have some funds in your deployer account to pay for the transaction.

```
yarn deploy --network <NETWORK_NAME>
```

e.g. `yarn deploy --network sepolia`

## Configuration of Third-Party Services for Production-Grade Apps.

By default, Scaffold-Stark 2 provides predefined API keys for popular services such as Infura. This allows you to begin developing and testing your applications more easily, avoiding the need to register for this service.

For production-grade applications, it's recommended to obtain your own API keys (to prevent rate limiting issues). You can configure these at:

- `RPC_URL_SEPOLIA` variable in `packages/snfoundry/.env` and `packages/nextjs/.env.local`. You can create API keys from the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).

:::tip Hint
It's recommended to store environment variables for nextjs in vercel/system env config for live apps and use `.env.local` for local testing.
