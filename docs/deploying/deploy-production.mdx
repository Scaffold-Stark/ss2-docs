# Optimize Your dApp for Production

When preparing your Scaffold-Stark 2 dApp for production deployment, there are several optimizations you can implement to improve performance and reduce bundle size.

## 1. Verify System Requirements

Before deploying to production, ensure you have the correct versions of all dependencies:

```bash
# Check versions
node --version        # >= v18.17
starknet-devnet --version  # 0.2.3
scarb --version      # 2.9.2
snforge --version    # 0.34.0
```

:::tip Hint
Using incompatible versions may cause unexpected issues in production. Make sure to align with the compatible versions specified in Scaffold-Stark 2.
:::tip Hint

## 2. Remove Debug Features

#### 1. Debug Page Removal

The debug page is a development tool that should be removed for production builds. You can remove it by:

Delete the debug page and its components:

```bash
rm -rf packages/nextjs/app/debug
```

#### 2. Remove the debug route from your navigation if you've added it manually in any of your components.

:::tip Hint
If you want to keep the debug features for development while removing them from production, you can use environment-based conditional rendering:

````typescript
{process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && (
  <Link href="/debug">Debug Contracts</Link>
)}

:::tip Hint

## 3. Asset optimization

### Image Optimization
Scaffold-Stark 2 comes with pre-configured image optimization in [`next.config.mjs`](https://github.com/Scaffold-Stark/scaffold-stark-2/blob/main/packages/nextjs/next.config.mjs). The configuration includes secure handling of SVGs and specific remote patterns for Starknet-related images.

#### 1. When adding new image sources, extend the existing `remotePatterns` in `next.config.mjs`:

```javascript
images: {
  dangerouslyAllowSVG: true,
  remotePatterns: [
    {
      protocol: "https",
      hostname: "your-new-domain.com",
      pathname: "/**",
    },
    // existing patterns...
  ],
}
````

#### 2. Use the Next.js Image component with the allowed domains:

```typescript
import Image from 'next/image';

export function YourComponent() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="https://identicon.starknet.id/your-image"
      alt="Description"
      width={400}
      height={300}
    />
  );
}
```

:::tip Hint
Only add domains to `remotePatterns` that you trust and need for your application. For each additional pattern may increases the potential attack surface of the application.
:::tip Hint

### Additional Build optimizations

Scaffold-Stark 2 includes several build optimizations in `next.config.mjs`:

#### 1. TypeScript and ESLint error handling:

```javascript
typescript: {
  ignoreBuildErrors: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_IGNORE_BUILD_ERROR === "true",
},
eslint: {
  ignoreDuringBuilds: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_IGNORE_BUILD_ERROR === "true",
},
```

#### 2. Webpack optimization for compatibility:

```javascript
webpack: (config) => {
  config.resolve.fallback = { fs: false, net: false, tls: false };
  config.externals.push("pino-pretty", "lokijs", "encoding");
  return config;
},
```

## 4. Production Environment Setup

#### Production Environment Variables

Ensure your production environment variables are properly set in your deployment platform:

```bash
# In packages/nextjs/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVIDER_URL=https://your-provider.example.com/your-api-key/rpc/v0_7
```

:::tip Hint
Make sure your RPC provider URL includes the correct version path (v0_7). You can verify the RPC version with this curl command:

```bash
# Verify RPC version (should be 0.7.1)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{
 "jsonrpc":"2.0",
 "method":"starknet_specVersion",
 "id":1
}' https://your-rpc-endpoint
```

Never commit production environment variables to your repository. Use .env.local for local development and configure environment variables directly in your deployment platform for production.
:::tip Hint

## 5. Build Optimization

#### Next.js Build Configuration

Optimize your Next.js build by adding the following to your `next.config.mjs`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // ... other config
  compiler: {
    removeConsole: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  },
  experimental: {
    optimizeCss: true,
  },
};
```

## 6. Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure you have:

- [ ] Removed or conditionally rendered debug packages
- [ ] Configured production environment variables
- [ ] Optimized all images and assets
- [ ] Run and tested production build locally
- [ ] Updated all RPC endpoints to production URLs
- [ ] Removed any hardcoded development addresses
- [ ] Verified all smart contract integrations
- [ ] Tested wallet connections on production networks

## Production Build Command

Use `yarn build` followed by `yarn start` to test your production build locally before deploying.

```bash
# Build the application
yarn build

# Test the production build locally
yarn start
```

## Common Pitfalls

- Leaving development RPC endpoints in production
- Not configuring proper environment variables
- Keeping debug routes accessible in production
- Using development contract addresses in production
- Not optimizing images and other assets
- Leaving console.log statements in production code
